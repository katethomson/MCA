	<h2 align="center">Similarity</h2>
<p>I removed the three country tracks and replaced them with hip-hop tracks and visualised the similarities, which are listed in the "Revised Visualisations" column.<br/><br/>
I then did a comparison of the similarities of six pieces of three different composers. I used the original MP3s of "I Giorni" and "Discovery at Night". I then chose two composers of the same genre, instrument, era and nationality, and used the MP3s to create chromagrams for "Wild Side" and "Outdoor by Roberto Cacciapaglia and "Aria" and "Back to Life" by Giovanni Allevi. This required amendments to the Python code to ensure that only six tracks were compared as opposed to nine. This produced a very interesting result and showed that all composers have their own sound, judged by the close proximity of the plotting in the first visualisation, but have elements of similarity to each other. See a PDF of how I achieved this at the bottom of the page.</p>

	<h2 align="center">Automated Transcription</h2>
	<p>On initial inspection, it is clear that the automatically transcribed piece appears much ‘busier’. It is also clear that the key and time signature have both been changed in the process. The rhythm of the piece has been altered which I think may have been partly due to the change in time signature. There are some notes which have been added. This could be because the program misinterpreted tied notes or rests, encouraging the addition of unnecessary notes. While the changes do not negatively affect the sound of the piece, it does sound different. Generally, I can commend the attempts of the software to transcribe the piece from the WAV file. The general theme of the piece is conveyed well, however the notated data is represented poorly. It is difficult to read, especially for a novice musician.</p>
