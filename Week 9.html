	<p>I compared the histograms of the chromagrams for each of the three tracks. I focussed on the first histograms of each series which illustrated the energy produced for the note C. In ‘Enthusiast’, the spike at the beginning of the histogram illustrates that the count for the presence of C is high at 0 energy. This demonstrates that the amount of C energy is actually often absent. In ‘Le Petit Jardin’, a similar spike at 0 energy is seen which suggests a lack of the note C. However, in ‘Frozen Egg’, the count of 0 energy is very low, whilst at higher levels of energy, the count is more regular than the other pieces. This suggests that the note C is more present in the piece. In ‘Enthusiast’, a more even distribution of the energy of the C note is seen than in ‘Le Petit Jardin’, which suggests that the presence of C is more regular. The biggest bin in ‘Enthusiast’ is at approximately 0.025 energy. This demonstrates that the note C is most common at this energy. The biggest bin in ‘Le Petit Jardin’ is approximately 0.015, demonstrating that the note C is more common at energy level 0.015. In ‘Frozen Egg’, the biggest bin is at 0.045, illustrating that the note C is most common at this energy.</p>
