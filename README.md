# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

<p>This is a dataset produced for the DMIS Music Curation Analytics course at the University of Glasgow.</p>

 <p>I chose to construct a dataset concerning the works of Italian pianist, Ludovico Einaudi . While Einaudi has composed many pieces, I chose to focus on two specifically chosen pieces because analysing more than two would be beyond the scope of this project. I decided to analyse two pieces which were written over a decade apart. The first piece, ‘I Giorni’, is written for solo piano and was released in 2001. This piece gained huge popularity and hit the UK Top 40 a mere decade later. The second, ‘Discovery at Night’, is a shorter piece written, again, for solo piano and released in 2013. This piece, although not unsuccessful, did not reach the same fame as ‘I Giorni’. As I chose these pieces, my theme developed and became a collection of data concerning two very similar pieces which were born over a decade apart but achieved varying degrees of success. </p>
